    "<b>Data science</b> is a field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It is a multi-disciplinary field that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of statistical and mathematical concepts and techniques to analyze and interpret data. Data science is concerned with using data to answer questions and solve problems, and it involves the collection, cleaning, and processing of data, as well as the development of algorithms and models to analyze and interpret the data. The goal of data science is to extract insights and knowledge from data that can be used to inform decisions and improve outcomes."

    "<b>Unstructured data</b>, on the other hand, is data that is not organized in a specific format. It is more difficult to analyze and interpret because it does not have a predetermined structure. Examples of unstructured data include text documents, images, and audio and video recordings.\n",
